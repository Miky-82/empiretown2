### 🚗 Vehicle Physics  
- **Wet and snowy roads:** Vehicles now have **more realistic physics** under adverse weather conditions:  
  - 🌧️ **Rain:** Increased skidding and braking difficulty.  
  - ❄️ **Snow:** Reduced vehicle control, making drifting easier. ⛷️  
  - ⚡ **Lightning:** Possible **engine overheating** during storms, temporarily slowing down vehicles.  

### ⏳ Weather Synchronization
